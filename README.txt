General Guidelines for submission & evaluation
You can submit your solutions here and the submissions will be evaluated by a team of random members (peer students).
 Evaluation will be initiated by any one of the Faculty if there is a huge difference in marks provided by your peers. 
This provides you an opportunity to see how others designed their sites and also understand how to evaluate work.
